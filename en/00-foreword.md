## 💡0-1 Why This Book?

### The "Gap" in Existing Books

Most deep learning books have a **gap between math and code**:

| Book Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|:----------|:----------|:-----------|
| Pure Math (e.g., *The Math of Deep Learning*) | Rigorous mathematical derivations | Uses Excel, cannot handle large-scale data, no automatic gradient computation |
| Engineering-Focused (e.g., *Dive into Deep Learning*) | Rich hands-on code | Math principles not deep enough; readers know "how" but not "why" |
| Academic Textbooks (e.g., Goodfellow's *Deep Learning*) | Complete theoretical system | Math门槛 too high; not suitable for self-study |

### The Bridge This Book Builds

This book builds a **bridge between mathematical intuition and code verification** — aiming not for mastery of derivation, but for **true understanding**.

> **Core Positioning**: Starting from fundamental math concepts, we'll **understand the mathematical principles behind deep learning** — using Python + PyTorch code to verify and visualize each concept, rather than doing formal mathematical derivations.

## 💡0-2 Book Features

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Understanding First** | Every数学原理 is explained with intuition and visualization before code |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib dynamically shows gradient descent, backpropagation in action |
| **PyTorch Native** | Gradual transition from manual NumPy to PyTorch autograd |
| **Transparent Derivation** | No hidden steps; every weight change at every layer is visible |
| **Comparison Experiments** | Every key环节 has manual vs. automatic computation comparison |

### Standard Chapter Rhythm

Each chapter follows a consistent "Concept → Visualization → Formula → Code" rhythm:

```text
Conceptual Intuition (a 30-word "what it's like")
    ↓
Visualization (let your eyes "see" the math first)
    ↓
Mathematical Formula (annotate every symbol's meaning)
    ↓
Code Verification ("look, here's how the math works in code")
    ↓
Core Insight (one sentence summary)
```

> **Tip**: If you're a beginner, follow the chapters in order. If you have prior knowledge, you can jump directly to the code sections and refer back to the formulas when you need details.

## 💡0-3 Environment Setup

### Hardware Requirements

All code in this book runs on an ordinary laptop:

- **Any computer that can run Python** (no GPU required)
- **8GB+ RAM recommended** (4GB works but training is slower)
- **Disk space**: ~2GB (including PyTorch, MNIST dataset, etc.)

> Even without a GPU, the code in this book runs fast enough — we won't be training ImageNet-scale models. All examples are small-scale mathematical verifications.

### Software Requirements

```bash
# Recommended: use conda or venv for a virtual environment
conda create -n dl_math python=3.10
conda activate dl_math

# Install core dependencies
pip install torch torchvision  # PyTorch 2.0+
pip install numpy matplotlib   # Scientific computing + visualization
pip install jupyter            # (Optional) interactive notebooks
```

#### Version Requirements

| Software | Minimum | Recommended |
|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| Python | 3.8 | 3.10+ |
| PyTorch | 1.13 | 2.0+ |
| NumPy | 1.21 | 1.24+ |
| Matplotlib | 3.5 | 3.7+ |

### Companion Code

- Chapter code files are in `../code/chNN/`
- File naming: `NN{chapter}_{function}.py`
- Recommended to run in Jupyter Notebook section by section

## 💡0-4 Reading Suggestions

### Sequential Reading Matters

The chapters have **strong dependencies**:

```text
Ch 1-2 (Fundamentals) → Ch 3 (Tools) → Ch 4-5 (Core) → Ch 6-9 (Advanced)
```

- **Chapters 1-4** are prerequisites for Chapter 5 (backpropagation, the core chapter)
- **Chapter 5** is a prerequisite for Chapter 6 (CNN)
- **Chapters 7-9** can be read selectively based on your interest

### How to Use This Book Efficiently

1. **First pass**: Read through quickly to build an overall picture
2. **Run the code**: Execute each chapter's Python code yourself
3. **Modify parameters**: Try changing learning rates, layer counts, activation functions
4. **Understand principles first, then code**: Mathematical intuition is the goal; code is the means of verification

### Stuck? Here's What to Do

- Can't understand a formula? → Read the "plain English explanation" right after it
- Code won't run? → Check dependency versions, or revert to the versions in `requirements.txt`
- Concept not clicking? → Skip it and continue; often, later content helps clarify earlier concepts

## 💡0-5 Core Philosophy: Understanding Math Principles, Not Formal Derivation

### Three Beliefs

#### 1. Math Intuition > Formula Derivation

> You don't need to derive backpropagation from scratch, but you need to **intuitively understand** why it works.

- Every formula is followed by a plain-English explanation: "The essence of this formula is..."
- Complex math is understood through **visualization** and **analogies**, not symbol manipulation

#### 2. Code Validates Intuition, It's Not the Star

> Each math concept is first explained through intuition → then shown as a formula → finally verified with code.

- Code is short, focused, runnable — not demonstrating programming skills, but showing math "in motion"
- No hidden intermediate steps: every layer's weight changes are observable

#### 3. Understanding = Knowing "Why" > Knowing "What"

> Every subsection of this book prioritizes answering "Why do we need this concept?"

- Then uses visualization to let you "see" the math
- Finally uses code to let you "touch" the math

---

### Three "Don'ts"

1. **No formal proofs**: We don't derive from axioms step by step; intuition is sufficient
2. **No unnecessary symbols**: We use $w$ instead of $\theta$, $x$ instead of $\xi$ wherever possible
3. **No assumed prior knowledge**: Every symbol is annotated with its meaning the first time it appears

> **One sentence summary**: After reading this book, you won't be a mathematician — but you will **intuitively understand** what math each step of a neural network is doing, and you'll be able to verify your understanding with code.

### Questions for Reflection

1. **Learning goals**: What 3 specific things do you want to learn from this book?
2. **Math self-assessment**: Rate your math level (1-5). Which concepts do you need to review most?
3. **Toolchain check**: Test your environment with `python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"`. If you encounter issues, try searching for solutions online.
